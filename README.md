# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Chen Benson*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [May 7th, 2025]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included review the places where it had the methods and use the things it give to first make a constructor and review if things connect properly.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were the FRQs as their instruction were convoluted to me.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me were skipping questions that I struggled on to view them later, as they would take too much time on focusin on solely one question I struggled at.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions I imagined what the return value would be and attempted to see what it may be used for.

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Inheritance: [I should remember how to create and make the line that helped put values into the parent and child classes]
- Typing: [I make small mistakes such as spelling errors and leaving out something without realizing]
- Sorting: [Be able to properly sort and grab a specific value from a array]

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- [Idependently study Computer Science and move onto a different area I previously took]
- [A restaurant game where you handle customsters and bills and have to juggle between costs and profit]
- [Ask for help in places where I struggle in to get advice]
